Shoop is a fictional online eCommerce website for shoes where users can buy and review a variety of different shoe types

This project was completed for my **Code Institute Milestone 4 Project**. The site is built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Javascript** for the front end and **Python, Django & PostgreSQL** for the back end. It is deployed on **Render** at the following location: **https://ms4-shoop.onrender.com**
